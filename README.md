# Web-and-App-Development-Tasks
This repository contains my task submissions for the Web and App Development course. Each folder includes code files, assignments, and practice exercises that I upload for review and feedback from my instructor. The purpose of this repo is to track my learning progress, manage version control, and share completed tasks easily using GitHub.
